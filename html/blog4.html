                <p class="para">Giovanna is a writer, blogger, vlogger and mum. Her blog content is mainly about her life as<br> a mother and a wife. She hosts a very popular podcast called Happy Mum, Happy Baby Podcast.<br><br>

                    I love the variety of content on her blog. She mixes it up between informative blog posts<br> about family life, what’s going on in her world and tips for mums and a really cool podcasts <br>that cover a variety of subjects to do with parenting and being a mum. The fact that she’s not <br>really hard selling at all is refreshing.</p>
