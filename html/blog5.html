                <p class="para">Another food blogger who fully understands the power of quality content and a knowledge of <br>how to monetize a website. Stephanie Le’s food blog is simple in design and in content form. <br>The stuff she posts is 100% actionable. All the recipes can be made from home and she brings<br> the content alive with amazing, high quality food photography. She gives it a personal touch<br> by adding a bit of commentary and background to the photos.<br><br>

                    There’s also a really clever monetization method she uses  with this page “What’s in My <br>Kitchen? Utensils Edition.” She can easily add in Amazon affiliate links to earn income from<br> this page, by recommending quality products that she uses on a daily basis.<br><br>
                    
                    This is a great example of an outstanding food niche blog. Think about what she’s doing well<br> and take note. Mouth watering photos, clean and simple theme layout, well formatted and<br> styled recipe pages, excellent writing, conversational tone, and relatable back stories to each post.
