                <p class="para">I’ve been following this site since it started and has seen its progression<br> from just one guy writing about stuff he loves, to a site that get’s decent traffic and has a team of writers.<br>

                    Knowtechie is a great example of a site that started out as a hobby but<br> has fast become a business. I like the angle they have as well. “Tech News For The Non Techie”.<br> KnowTechie is a blog for people who love tech, but live outside the bubble. This is so refreshing,<br> because so many tech blogs out there are a bit too technical and full to the brim of jargon. It’s nice to see a tech blog that has lowered the entry level to tech news.
